* associative array: like a Ruby hash or JS object.
  * ```$person = ['age' => 31, 'hair' => 'brown', 'occupation' => 'web dev'];```
  * ```var_dump($person);``` will basically echo associative array, but unformatted

* ```die();``` stops the execution of the file, can take an argument

* ```unset();``` removes a value from the array

* ```<?= ... ?>``` shorthand for ```<?php echo ... ?>```
